## About
This is group of easing functions in C#. Which can be used to transition a changing numeric value from an origin to a destination value in a visually pleasing way.

Here's an example of the *Quartic In-Out* ease function.

### How to use
- View the [Easing folder README](/Easing) for a detailed description on this class library.
- Seeing the code in the [Easing Demo project](/Easing.Demo) would be a great way to see a real world implementation of this class library.
- You can also look at the [Easing tests](/Easing.Test/Functions) to see many cases where I used the ease classes and how I used them.
- Keep in mind, these easing classes follow mathematical functions, you can see the formulas for these functions in the [EaseFormulas Excel document](/EaseFormulas.xlsx). You can also use this for inspiration if you want to make your own ease class.
