## About
This is group of easing functions in C#. Which can be used to transition a changing numeric value from an origin to a destination value in a visually pleasing way.

Here's an example of the *Quartic In-Out* ease function.

### How to use
View the [Easing folder README](/Easing) for a detailed description for how to use this.

You can also look at the [Easing tests](/Ease.Test/Functions) to see many cases where I used the ease classes and how I used them.

Keep in mind, these easing classes follow mathematical functions, you can see the formulas for these functions in the 
[EaseFormulas Excel document](/EaseFormulas.xlsx). You can also use this for inspiration if you want to make a new ease class.
